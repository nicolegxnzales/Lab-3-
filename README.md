# Lab 3: Department Sales Calculation Program

## Description
This program allows a manager to determine and display the total sales for the department. The manager enters the monthly sales goal and inputs the weekly sales for each salesperson over four weeks. After each salesperson, the program asks if there is another salesperson to input. Once all sales are entered, the program calculates the total department sales, the number of employees, and the manager's bonus. If total sales exceed the goal, the manager earns a 5% bonus; otherwise, the bonus is 2%.
